# xfce-to-windows-10-INCOMPLETE
This script (once I finish it) will instantly convert your xfce desktop to a windows 10 like feel
Remember, since this is unfinished, there are no pictures to display of the end result.

also IDK why it's saying its like 98% CSS, I wrote this in 100% bash, the language that Linux uses. Then again, this is my first project, it could be kali's windows 10 theme triggering it. IDK...

*picture will go here*
