# xfce-to-windows-10-INCOMPLETE
This script (once I finish it) will instantly convert your xfce desktop to a windows 10 like feel
Remember, since this is unfinished, there are no pictures to display of the end result.

also IDK why it's saying its like 98% CSS, I wrote this in 100% bash, the language that Linux uses. Then again, this is my first project, it could be kali's windows 10 theme triggering it. IDK...

You will need to right click the datetime and change the font to liberation serif size 9 however, if you want a near identical copy. I do not know the commands to do this automatically. Feel free to copy my project and add whatever you like to it, or make your own for KDE-plasma or GNOME.

Oh! I found a login screen copy!:

Also well... Windows-10 obviously...
mail icon is located in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_16005.11629.20316.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\images\HxMail (followed by odd letters or whatnot. Its MANY logos.) however, you will need to right click, and add yourself to the security tab and stuff. Very complicated, not going into it.

windows media player icon is located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe" however you will need something like icon viewer in order to actually use this, and the convert the .exe to .ico and convert the .ico to .png

Photos icon is located in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Windows.Photos_2019.19071.12548.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\Assets\PhotosAppList.targetsize- (followed by the size of the image.) Again, you need to take ownership.

Groove Music Icon is in "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.ZuneMusic_10.19071.19011.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\Assets\contrast-black\AppList.targetsize-" (again weird numbers)
